I was able to successfully move into a web development role in 7 months , which was amazing. All this would not have been possible without the consistent efforts of the Skillslash team. They have very good instructors and a very engaging classroom which is why i was able to learn the important skills very quickly. They also have a very systematic career guidance track with which i was able to get a lot of interviews before i landed a role but i had consistent support. The best part of my learning was in some of the projects that i did with them. My interviews were all about my projects and i was well prepared for that. Kudos to the team and i wish my best for Skillslash. This is definitely a great place to learn for working professionals. One simple conversation with their counsellor and i was convinced that they are honest people with great interest and experience in the field. You must consider this if you are looking to build a career in web development.",

I really appreciate the professional assistance as well as the course instructors. The faculty were prompt and clarifies doubts immediately . every penny invested here for the purpose of learning is far more than being just worth it . Before enrolling myself i researched alot about all the online learning systems and found skillslash to be more feasible and  economically more viable. I appreciate the assistance given to me by Mr.Chandra , who happened to be my course counsellor . Overall the experience was damn good and i feel skillslash is far better than the other big players like upgrad and great learning.The main advantage of skillslash over other learning platforms is that in skillslash every class is a live class. recordings are provided after the class live class. So yeah it is more like a classroom program. Thank you Skillslash",
